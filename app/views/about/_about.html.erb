			    <p> As thousands of newcomers pour into the city each month, even more thousands of disadvantaged familys are displaced from their city homes and resources. Many are the victims of legal, but potentially unethical, nofault eviction practices, including Ellis Acts, as well as other "soft-pressure" tactics such as delayed maintenance, and implied legal action. If this matters to you, then we're here to help you make more informed housing choices.</p>

			    <p>The GentrEviction Project. We've collected thousands of public records for Ellis Acts, Owner Move-ins, and Condo conversions, and combined it with tenant reported eviction pressures for the building units in our database. Our proprietary algorithm then generates a <span class="scoop">"Scoops Score"</span> to index the negative actions that made the unit available... the lower the index, the more questionable the unit's ehtical origins. </p>
